Weekly, we meet on one of the many caf\u00e9s situated only a few metres from our home or perhaps we go to the new cinema 5 minutes walk from here. We also love to ride our bycycles to the very center of Copenhagen. As often as possible we spend time in our country house where we especially enjoy the silence, the fresh air and most of all the look of the sea.  We like to travel to places with beautifull nature where we can go skiing, hiking, surfing and sailing; Austria, New Zealand, France, Italy, Norway, Iceland etc. Also long weekends in Europe's big citys are a break we very much appreciate. In a few words: We love life and try to make the best of every day.",

I consider old friendships pressure but also like getting to know new people. Think family is very important and spending quality time with the people I love. Adventurous in cooking. Always trying out new recipes. Right now I am very much into vegetarian cooking. I like experiencing and learning new cultures and like to spend time in my family house in Andaluc\u00eda in Spain. \r\n\r\nMy friends tell me that I make a good friend. I love my two girls Maria and Filippa and I am very proud of them. Maria is going to study psychology and Filippa medicin. \r\n\r\nI understand myself as a \u201dconnector\u201d, where it is an important foundation in my life that I like to bring people together. That is also why I feel connected to the idea of Airbnb. It mirrors important values in my own life - the way I want to live, share, travel and focus.  \r\n\r\nThere is a song saying: if you give a little take a little, then you're gonna get a lotta lovin. I believe in this having worked as a lobbyist for many years, being a secretary spokeman for an NGO and today doing research and project management in welfare partnerships. Where I\u2019m working the transition helping leaders of government authorities, interest organizations and businesses understand how they may engage in mutually beneficial partnerships and thereby innovate the ways in which we understand welfare, values in life, scared economy and worklife.",

The router is on the ground floor so the signal may be weak if you use a mobile to connect. We are sharing a capped connection with our neighbours on the ground floor, so we kindly ask that you minimize the use of streaming or downloading of videos and music thank you.  - Please note that the apartment has recently been put on the market for sale. This means that we may need to allow an estate agent to enter the apartment with potential buyers in order to view it. We will inform you as soon as a viewing is scheduled (usually they are held around lunch time for 30 minutes), sometimes we might only get this information a day before unfortunately.",

Maja (I) works as a Management Advisor in the best and largest insurance company in Denmark, and Alberto own a painting company. We love doing many different things together, inside the house as well as outside in the garden. We spend many hours outside taking care of the garden and the house and watch things grow! We also like to do things in our local area, which offer many opportunities, as well as traveling outside Denmark. Alberto is Danish/Spanish, so we speak Spanish and love to visit Spain and the family in Spain. We have made lots of home exchanges during the last years and know how to behave and take good care of other people's house. And now we have gladly had quite a few experiences with Airbnb, both as hosts and guests. Feel at home and welcome in our house - you will love it, we do!",

Brumleby is quiet and laidback yet only meters away from the hustle and bustle of Copenhagen. We offer 80m2 of comfort and a small garden to relax in. We have one bedroom with a double bed, two kidsrooms with according beds (age 4 & 8), on request we can offer adult-size-mattresses instead. A small but well equipped kitchen. The livingroom has TV, playstation, netflix, music, and WiFi. The garden is where we spend our time when the weather permits it...see photos. Main access is through our private garden.  On the other side of the house you'll find a small shared garden with the other tennants. On this side you'll also have access to the shared wash/utility house where you can wash and dry your clothes. Brumleby has its own playground in the center (you can see it from our garden) and lots of free space between the small buildings. A friendly neighbor will be able to assist you if need be during you",

The neighbours are all very sweet and around the same age (25-40 years). Everything is rennovated in modern standards inside the houses. THE LOCAL PARK (+ LOTS OF PLAYGROUNDS) We're 5 minutes away from the huge park called F\u00e6lledparken. It offers a lot of great playgrounds for all ages as well as sport and leisure facilities.  THE LOCAL MUSEUM: On a rainy day there's the Zoological Museum further down the street, on the way to F\u00e6lledparken. THE LOCAL BEACH: The nearest beach is called Svanem\u00f8llen.

We live in the north western part of Copenhagen close to city and neighbor to the city's most stunning nature, the Utterslev Mose (marsh). We both love traveling, especially if it is combined with working or serving some other kind of function locally, and have worked as doctors or medical students in Ecuador, Peru, Greenland, Spain, USA, and Tanzania. Since we became parents, our travels have mainly been for pleasure and relaxation, and we have greatly enjoyed living with airbnb hosts. It is new for us being hosts ourselves, but we look very much forward to meeting new friendly people and share our beloved home and city.\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n\r\n:-) Stine",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Connections to Copenhagen centre is very easy, but Hellerup itself also has about everything to offer. Strandvejen is perfect for shopping in either designer flagship stores or one of the many convenience stores. Our favourite cafe \"Coffee Collective\" or \"Emmerys\" is right around the corner. Enjoy your breakfast here or buy it to bring home from one of the many prima organic bakerys within walking distance. Do as the inhabitants of Hellerup and enjoy a traditional freshly made ice cream from the shops of Strandvejen and take a stroll down to the idyllic Hellerup Harbour. Here you also find the local sandy beach. It is safe for children and an everyday swim in the summertime is a must! Parks for recreation, playing or excercise are close by.",
    "notes": "We have a cat living in the apartment though it will not be around during your stay. The apartment will be cleaned before your arrival, but if you are highly allergic, it might be useful to know.",
    "transit": "Connections to Copenhagen city centre are many and very easy. Take either the bus 1A (leaves every 10 min. just around the corner) directly to city centre or use the train from Hellerup Station 5 min. walk away. From here you can also take trains directly to the airport. We recommend a trainride towards north for either Louisiana Museum of Modern Art or Dyrehaven, a major park with wild living deers and the beautiful Eremitage Castle.",

No pets and no smoking except on the little balcony please. Please do not play music outside and be kind not to play music after 10 pm. Final cleaning is included in the price, though we expect you to take good care of the appartment and to leave it in the same condition as it was upon arrival. Please tidy up and carry down the litter before you leave.",
