        "neighborhood_overview": "Frederiksberg is an old part of the Copenhagen area with beautiful old buildings and villas. We love living here because there are plenty of restaurants, caf\u00e9s, shops and our favourite park - Frederiksberg Garden. Also, it is a 5-10 minute walk from the vibrant areas of Vesterbro and N\u00f8rrebro. Central Copenhagen is only a bike ride away too. We love this because it means you are close to everything but that you can also come back to a more quiet area at night.",
        "notes": "If you are meeting friends in Copenhagen, it is possible to fit two extra people in our livingroom - one on the couch and one on our air matress. Please notify us in advance if you will be more than two people - also as you are not allowed to bring anyone else to the apartment during your stay without our knowledge.",

Vesterbro Station is a 10-15 minute walk and Copenhagen Central Train Station is about a 20 minute walk away. There is a bike store two minutes from our place where you can rent bikes. The brand new public Copenhagen Bikes can also be rented on an hourly basis right by Forum Station. Bikes are the perfect way to see the city! If you arrive in car, there is parking in our street and the neighbour streets. It costs 35 kroner to park a full day. You can buy the parking ticket at SevenEleven.",

All other food, you can easily buy at our favourite supermarket Rema1000 right by Forum Station, or the more luxury stores like Irma or F\u00f8tex - both a five minute walk away. There will be a light breakfast available consisting of traditional Danish dark bread, butter, jam, milk, oats and fruit. Please let us know if you do not wish to have the breakfast during your stay. If you are traveling with an infant, our apartment is also perfect as we just had a son in May 2016. There's a changing table and NaturesSway bed available to use for your baby while staying here, as well as some toys if you wish. Just let us know and we'll leave it out for you!",
        "interaction": "We list our place when we are out of town, so unless our paths cross on the days of arrival and departure, you will have the apartment to yourself. This also means you have to be ok with possibly not meeting us at all. We have great experience with letting friends welcoming guests, if we are away upon your arrival.",
        "house_rules": "We want you to feel welcome and at home, and in return we expect our guests to show respect and treat our furniture and belongings with care and attention. We kindly ask that you don't bring any other people to our apartment while living here. Also, please respect that this is a non-smoking home. We hope you will enjoy your cigarettes in our backyard instead. No pets are allowed in our building. If you should spill or break anything, please let us know as soon as possible in order to help fix it!",

Our house is not old, it is from 1985.... There are three floors, and we live on the third with the nice view!! In the summer all the tourists makes me feel like a tourist myself: ) all in all........ I think it\u00b4s just perfect.",

Together we have two grown up girls who both live nearby and often drop by for a chat or a meal. Weekly, we meet on one of the many caf\u00e9s situated only a few metres from our home or perhaps we go to the new cinema 5 minutes walk from here. We also love to ride our bycycles to the very center of Copenhagen. As often as possible we spend time in our country house where we especially enjoy the silence, the fresh air and most of all the look of the sea.  We like to travel to places with beautifull nature where we can go skiing, hiking, surfing and sailing; Austria, New Zealand, France, Italy, Norway, Iceland etc. Also long weekends in Europe's big citys are a break we very much appreciate. In a few words: We love life and try to make the best of every day.",

I consider old friendships pressure but also like getting to know new people. Think family is very important and spending quality time with the people I love. Adventurous in cooking. Always trying out new recipes. Right now I am very much into vegetarian cooking. I like experiencing and learning new cultures and like to spend time in my family house in Andaluc\u00eda in Spain. \r\n\r\nMy friends tell me that I make a good friend. I love my two girls Maria and Filippa and I am very proud of them. Maria is going to study psychology and Filippa medicin. \r\n\r\nI understand myself as a \u201dconnector\u201d, where it is an important foundation in my life that I like to bring people together. That is also why I feel connected to the idea of Airbnb. It mirrors important values in my own life - the way I want to live, share, travel and focus.  \r\n\r\nThere is a song saying: if you give a little take a little, then you're gonna get a lotta lovin. I believe in this having worked as a lobbyist for many years, being a secretary spokeman for an NGO and today doing research and project management in welfare partnerships. Where I\u2019m working the transition helping leaders of government authorities, interest organizations and businesses understand how they may engage in mutually beneficial partnerships and thereby innovate the ways in which we understand welfare, values in life, scared economy and worklife.",

We love doing many different things together, inside the house as well as outside in the garden. We spend many hours outside taking care of the garden and the house and watch things grow! We also like to do things in our local area, which offer many opportunities, as well as traveling outside Denmark. Alberto is Danish/Spanish, so we speak Spanish and love to visit Spain and the family in Spain. We have made lots of home exchanges during the last years and know how to behave and take good care of other people's house. And now we have gladly had quite a few experiences with Airbnb, both as hosts and guests. Feel at home and welcome in our house - you will love it, we do!",

During the last 10 years I have worked for an International NGO to fight poverty and social injustice. \r\n\r\nMy husband is Dutch and together we have two lovely girls, age 4 and 5. We love colors in life and to go with the flow -  \"If life is bitter ask for tequila and salt\". We have no expensive architecture furniture, but space for creativity and play - both inside and outside.\r\n\r\nWe LOVE our house, garden, good neighborhood, great neighbors, GREEN COPENHAGEN and to bike through city. All this we would like to share with other people around the world, and we know how great it is to have private accommodation - especially when traveling with kids.",

I love living in Copenhagen, especially in my own neighborhood. \r\nI live in a red brick house with my family at four, looking out at a nice little oasis of a garden. \r\n\r\n14 years ago my husband and I moved to this working class klondyke in an old area of Copenhagen because of the house and the location. The Metro came to town and suddenly we could get around the city smooth and easily. \r\nThis was a place with options and soul. \r\n\r\nToday the area is a colorful pattern of creative people, families, schools, gyms, galleries and temples and churches of various religions. \r\nI love that this is a place with space for cats, dogs, ideas and the typical Danish broadmindedness. \r\n\r\nCooking, eating and cooking are keywords in my family - especially classic Danish dishes. When our family does dine out, however, we often do it locally. The traditional Danish open-faced sandwich called Sm\u00f8rebr\u00f8d is one of our favorites and there are plenty of sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8dsshops around. \r\nWe also love The Korean place around the corner, not to mention enjoying a cup of Coffee and a piece of layer cake at cool Lagkagehuset in the shoppingstreet. \r\n\r\nWe travel a lot with our two teenage boys Mikkel and Mathias. France is a favorite. But we are also typical Danes from the north. Both bright summer nights and long, dark evenings with fireplaces and candles in the fall and winter are greatly admired. \r\n\r\nIn rain, fog and sunny weather I always ride my bike to work and Copenhagen never stops surprising me. My motto for the ride is to find a new route every day. Travelling around by bike, I can highly recommend.\r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to warmly welcome you.",

In Frederiksberg, you'll also find the best shopping center in Europe called \"Frederiksberg Centret\" as well as many other cute stores and cozy caf\u00e9s. Frederiksberg is kind of the more \"mature\" part of Copenhagen, and it's perfect if you like it just a little bit calm, but still want something happening around you.  Very close to Frederiksberg you'll find the cool and urban N\u00f8rrebro. N\u00f8rrebro has a lot to offer with something happening all the time.

Here you'll find many different places to eat, bars and cultural happenings.

        "notes": "I don't have any curtains in my bedroom since I enjoy the light, but if you prefer it, I'll put up something to work as a curtain so you can sleep in.  I have both a toilet and a bathroom in the apartment, it's just separated as you can see in the pictures, which can be very practical if you're two persons staying here together.",
        "transit": "The possibilities for public transportation are very good. Depending on where you're going, there are different bus stops close by. The nearest bus stop being just across the street. Near by you'll also find a train station.  Appr. 1 kilometer from the apartment you'll find the metro station (Fasanvej Metro) where you can go very easily to the city center or the airport. It's very easy to get to the apartment from the airport in Copenhagen (Kastrup Airport). Take the metro to Fasanvej St. and then take bus 4a which stops just across the street. It'll take appr. 45 minutes.  If you want to get around by bike you can rent the city bikes just 100 metres from the apartment. It doesn't get easier than that. There are plenty of possibilities for grocery shopping as well. You'll find at least 5 different (and good) stores for grocery shopping within 400 metres. The nearest one is only 150 meters from the apartment.",

Also if you have any questions, you can always send me an e-mail or text and I'll answer as soon as I can.  Depending on how many will book the apartment, I'll probably have some help from a friend, who I know is also more than willing to help with good tips for the city.",

We live in the north western part of Copenhagen close to city and neighbor to the city's most stunning nature, the Utterslev Mose (marsh). We both love traveling, especially if it is combined with working or serving some other kind of function locally, and have worked as doctors or medical students in Ecuador, Peru, Greenland, Spain, USA, and Tanzania. Since we became parents, our travels have mainly been for pleasure and relaxation, and we have greatly enjoyed living with airbnb hosts. It is new for us being hosts ourselves, but we look very much forward to meeting new friendly people and share our beloved home and city.\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n\r\n:-) Stine",
